# This is the code for our published paper: 'A multi-criterion evaluation approach for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms'
This paper has not been published. In the future, everyone is welcome to use this code and cite our paper.

# Running the code
You can run the 'main.m' file to evaluate data
The proposed evaluation model is calculated through Cplex. The program can be found in 'EvaluationModel.m'.
Note that using 'linprog' may result in errors due to significant differences in data dimensions
